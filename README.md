# fancyfifteen
A Twenty Fifteen child theme to hold all of the miscellaneous tweaks I want to share on my blog.

I'll update this as I go along. Code will be kept separate for ease of picking out specific functionality to use elsewhere.

Contents so far:
Accordion-folded sidebar widgets (involves style.css, aqa-sidebar-accordion.js, functions.php)
