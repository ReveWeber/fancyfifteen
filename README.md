# fancyfifteen
A Twenty Fifteen child theme to hold all of the miscellaneous tweaks I want to share on my blog.

I'll update this as I go along. Code will be kept separate for ease of picking out specific functionality to use elsewhere. All pertinent blog posts will be tagged "[fancyfifteen](http://www.rweber.net/tag/fancyfifteen/)".

## Contents so far

* Accordion-folded sidebar widgets: involves style.css, aqa-sidebar-accordion.js, functions.php
* Flickity carousel applied to Media Library Assistant galleries (good candidate for plugin): involves style.css, aqa-carousel.js, functions.php; instructions for setting up MLA are [on my blog](http://www.rweber.net/web-development/css/gilding-the-gallery-mla-flickity/)
