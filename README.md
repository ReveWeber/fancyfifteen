# fancyfifteen
A Twenty Fifteen child theme to hold all of the miscellaneous tweaks I want to share on my blog.

I'll update this as I go along. Code will be kept separate for ease of picking out specific functionality to use elsewhere. All pertinent blog posts will be tagged "[fancyfifteen](http://www.rweber.net/tag/fancyfifteen/)".
